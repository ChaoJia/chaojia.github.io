Hi, I'm Chao Jia ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): `/tʃaʊ. dʒʌ/`). I started my work at TU Wien in 2018 as a doctoral [research assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_assistant) in the [Rendering and Modeling group](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/group/Rendering-and-Modeling) after I got my Master's degree in computer science from [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/). I'm interested in real-time rendering, high-performance C++, physically based simulation and general-purpose computing on GPU (mainly CUDA, a bit OpenCL). Recently I have been working on my Vulkan renderer with C++, focusing on ray-traced global illumination and spatio-temporal denoising techniques.
